# PSI to the Power
### The wave that synchronizes compassionate minds to a rhythm and moving bodies to a movement.

The gap between science and eastern spiritual tradition is closing down, more and more people are rejecting the polarization fueled by traditional institutions.

We believe there is an underground revolution and we want to be part of it.

## Bear with us...
- Mindfulness meditation is finally becoming a common practice to overcome personal and collective traumas. As a consequence, self awareness and better access to general knowledge are improving critical thinking.
- The painful idea that one's identity is monolithic and dictated by the social context is now discarded. The reality is too complex for individuality to be considered as a whole. Identity is a tool to describe a specific role in the game we all play.
- Time is a convention and is becoming too constrictive. As in nature there are cycles, so our "identities" need specific rhythms. When people express the same identity they become one, like drops of water in the ocean.
- While most of the media are shrinking their formats trying to compete for attention, electronic music is on a totally different trajectory. DJs and producers collaborate and play each other's music in a fluid creative process that doesn't leave space to egoistic instances.
- A DJ Set is the perfect way to convey complex feelings to a very deep level, providing the perfect "rhythm" for every "identity"

## The project
PTTP's immediate goal is to create virtual places where DJ sets of electronic music are played in sequence according to specific criteria.

These virtual "venues" are the expression of "use cases" rather than genres, almost like wine labels like:
- Energetic and engaging, perfect for parties and house cleanings
- Mystical with ethnic flavours, memories of Burning Man and beach side parties on the sunset
- Hypnotic and deep, perfect for an introspective journey

A venue might have one, two or three floors, based on the intensity of the music.
Each floor has a lineup of DJs playing their sets at specific times, just like a club.

When accessing the web page of a venue, it is possible to just listen/dance to the stream of videos or help to make the video selection more accurate by voting each Set out or to a different floor.

Thanks to the great job of channels like [Mixmag](https://www.youtube.com/c/Mixmag), [DanceTelevision](https://www.youtube.com/c/dancetrippin), [Cercle](https://www.youtube.com/c/Cercle) and many more, for now all the music that we need can be played from YouTube. Of course, ads are going to be a little annoying, but we want artists to have revenues at any time.

If the project takes off, we will try to ask for original videos and find ways to remunerate producers and creators.

### Tech stack and Roadmap
First Stage: Cheap startup:

- Building a static html page to test hosting, CDN and SSL
- Converting the project to ReactJS and TypeScript
- Creating a mock server to expose static json data to activate playback as soon as possible
- Build venue dynamic page
- Enable forms to allow dancers to suggest Sets, DJs and channels for each venues and in general
