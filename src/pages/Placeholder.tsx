        <h1>The Guide</h1>
        <p>We believe that <strong>DJs/Producers</strong> are more than artists.</p>
        <p>They understand and connect with their people beyond music and fashion, constantly checking the pulse of the community and providing relief to social tension.</p>
        <p>The DJ lives art on a constant basis with the ultimate goal of sharing moments of joy with their tribe.</p>
        <p>We celebrate and thank our Shamans</p>
      </section>

      <section id="music" className="Placeholder-section">
        <h1>The Breath</h1>
        <p>Music, like languages and mathematics, is a human form of communication, but unlike them, it is also <strong>Rhythm</strong> and rhythm transcends human limits.</p>
        <p>Time is not linear and everything flows according to multiple simultaneous cycles.</p>
        <p>While most of the media are shrinking their formats trying to compete for attention, electronic music is on a totally different trajectory.</p>
        <p>We believe that a DJ Set is the perfect way to convey complex feelings to a very deep level.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="dance" className="Placeholder-section">
        <h1>The Way</h1>
        <p>We believe in Dance as a form of meditation and self discovery. Mind and body finally give up control and really stand in that beat.</p>
        <p>Every cell of our body contains the memory of this ancestral mating ritual, unregulated and visceral.</p>
        <p>And it is when dancing together, that <strong>we become one</strong>. Literally.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="wave" className="Placeholder-section">
        <h1>Î¨<sup>2</sup></h1>
        <p>The gap between science and eastern spiritual tradition is closing down, more and more people are rejecting the polarization fueled by traditional institutions.</p>
        <p>Regulated access to recreational drugs in a safe environment is also important to achieve personal and collective awareness.</p>
        <p><strong>PSI to the power is the wave that synchronizes compassionate minds to a rhythm and moving bodies to a movement.</strong></p>
